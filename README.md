## üîç Project Insights

This Power BI dashboard was created to analyze trends in **loan applications** over time, with a strong focus on **time-based performance tracking**. The primary objective is to help stakeholders ‚Äî such as bank managers or analysts ‚Äî quickly assess how loan demand is changing month-over-month and track short-term activity.

### üéØ Business Questions Answered:
- How many loan applications were received this month so far?
- How does current MTD (Month-to-Date) performance compare to the same period last month?
- Are we seeing a positive or negative trend in loan applications?
- What is the overall volume of applications over time?

### üìä Key Analytical Features:
- **Total Loan Applications**: Overall volume, always visible for top-level monitoring.
- **MTD vs. PMTD Comparison**: Shows whether performance is improving or declining this month.
- **MoM Growth %**: Helps track growth or decline in applications across months.
- **Running Totals**: Makes trend analysis smooth by showing accumulation over time.
- **Time Intelligence**: Built using advanced DAX (e.g., `DATESMTD()`, `DATEADD()`, `CALCULATE()`) to produce accurate comparisons.

### üìà Observations:
- The dashboard clearly shows **seasonal trends** in loan applications.
- There is often a dip in applications in certain months, which could be tied to external factors 
- By comparing **MTD to PMTD**, decision-makers can quickly see if current performance is ahead or behind.

### üß† Strategic Value:
- Enables **real-time tracking** of loan performance with daily or monthly views.
- Allows teams to take **early action** if trends are downward (e.g., plan marketing or outreach).
- A strong base for further additions like **loan approval rates**, **default risk**, or **branch performance**.
